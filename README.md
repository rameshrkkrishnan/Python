The dataset focusing on analyzing and visualizing salary distributions across various teams, positions, and age groups. 
The primary goal is to gain insights into salary expenditures by team and position, examine the correlation between age and salary, 
and represent findings with visual aids to simplify data interpretation.

As per mentioned in the question, for preprocessing the data in the "height" column is replaced with random numbers between 150 and 180. 
Checked if there is any null values in the dataset. The analysis tasks performed are determined the distribution of employees across each team, 
segregated employees based on their positions, identified the predominant age group among employees, discovered which team and position have the 
highest salary expenditure and investigated if there's any correlation between age and salary.

Created graphical representations for each of these analysis. Key insights derived from the analysis include, the Cleveland Cavaliers emerged as the team 
with the highest salary expenditure, the Center (C) position received the highest salary expenditure across all teams and a trend is showing 
between player age and salary which interpret whether age impacts earning potential.
